	<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
    <p>
	When I was younger, I had never used the term writer and applied it to myself. When people asked about my mother I told them she was a writer. She was constantly putting out new blog pieces and quietly scribbling away in copious amounts of journals she seemed to fill up with lightning speed. When people asked about my sister, I told them she was a writer, but one concerned with the facts, the “true story” of it all. She knew this was what she wanted to do from the minute she sat in a room with other self proclaimed writers. I had tried using the term writer for myself, but for some reason it had always felt like I was wearing the wrong name tag. It was too similar to that of my family members and therefore I was the one that needed to change because I felt like an intruder. Not calling myself a writer didn’t mean that wasn’t exactly what I was already doing. I’ve kept a diary from the time I was seven, going through waves of filling the pages, and then droughts of dry spells with no words to be said. It just has taken me years of practice to be able to call myself one.
With my growing confidence in calling myself a “writer”, I’ve found myself often obsessing about exactly what kind of writer I am. Am I strictly creative? Am I journalistic and factual? Am I poetic? I’ve moved in and around each of these labels, trying to find one that sticks and one that feels like me. In practicing I’ve found some words that feel right to me, like trying on a bunch of different hats to find one and instead I’ve found a handful. I’m an intuitive writer: I write when the urge compels me, waiting for it to take hold so that I can pour my soul out onto the page. I’m an emotional writer: I let my sadness control my words to spin into a story, I let my anger write all over the paper until it’s gone, I let my joy bound and soar and take over my scribbling hand. I’m a creative writer: constantly conjuring scenes in my head and letting them play out as my fingers type too fast for my brain to keep up with. I feel comfortable in the world in between words I’ve created for myself, weaving each label I acquire into a blanket to keep myself warm.
Journaling has helped me find my footing in writing. I feel immensely grateful for this practice because it’s taught me to channel my emotions and leave nothing unsaid; put everything into words to give it new life, new meaning. It’s created new perspectives for me and kept my safe haven for my most personal feelings and thoughts intact. At this point in my life, I don’t think I have fully found my voice as a writer. As far as I know, I could never have just one voice for writing but instead be made of a collection of many. As for where I am right now, using that voice is definitely something I know how to do.
