    <h1>I Am a Gay Person and I Am Begging Every Pedestrian to Please Walk Faster</h1>
	<p style = "text-indent: 50px;">
	I don’t know what warrants the correlation between a sexual orientation that is anything but straight and walking like you’re running at least 8 minutes late for a very important meeting. But alas, it exists. As a gay person, I walk everywhere with such speed that I no longer rely on Apple Maps to tell me how long it’s going to take to get somewhere on foot. It could be the Doc Martens giving incredible traction that allows me to reach such speeds. Or it could be the raging anxiety coursing through my veins that could either be genetic or caused by the heavily caffeinated oat milk lattes I consume daily.</p>
    <p style = "text-indent: 50px;">
Nevertheless, when other people fail to match my speed on the sidewalks, it causes some level (a lot) of frustration. Having to constantly weave my way in out of people who are just trying to take a leisurely walk to class is exhausting. This is especially the case when I’m running 3-5 minutes early but cannot slow down. Ever. So please. Consider this my formal petition to create speed minimums on the sidewalks. Personally, I think a speed of 3-4 mph on sidewalks is comfortably generous. This way people can get to places with unmatched levels of efficiency. Even straight people. What’s this? I’ve had a revolutionary idea! If someone needed to stop for a second, reply to a text, or stare blankly off into space, they could simply PULL OVER instead of blocking the small space of sidewalk where fellow queer people are walking at a completely rational pace. </p>
    <p style = "text-indent: 50px;">
I think it is a fairly reasonable request to also remove slow walkers from all sidewalks. Who needs to take a contemplative, reflective stroll on the way to a destination when you can crank Phoebe Bridgers in your headphones and arrive at your location in half of the time? This way you have time to overthink your entire life or just your extensive choice of jewelry for the day in the extra time you gain.</p>
    <p style = "text-indent: 50px;">
I understand that not everyone may see my campaign as something worth thinking about or even something to consider. They might even think I am targeting people and singling them out (I am). This is purely a movement for the better of society. If people walked at the same speed (fast), who knows how much we could have advanced as a society by now. Hey, we might even have flying cars or answers to the Taylor Swift/Karlie Kloss “kissgate” phenomenon. I know how dramatic this must sound, but please hear out your local gays who are everywhere, despite being in disguise by all of the rainbow propaganda we are not wearing on a daily basis. We are begging you. Please hear our humble (and angry) cry to every straight pedestrian to for the love of God pick up the pace on the sidewalks. Your community queers thank you (in advance) and hope you honor this request as a trade off for years of oppression.</p>
