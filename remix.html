	one of my professors asked me to write about who i am as a writer and tbh i have no fucking clue lol. my mom’s a writer and my sister is actually a journalist (degree and all) so i feel like they both kinda fall under that category. i write all the time but it’s not like i’m a capital W Writer. like i have journals and shit and i’ve kept a diary from the ripe age of seven but i feel like i almost have to have it be my career or purpose or something to be able to call myself that. like proper inkwells and shit with quills and those fancy lil leather bound journals. it’s like jo march core writing in the dark and i think i am as far from that as i can fucking get lol. does anyone else feel like this? i don’t even know if it’s what i want to do with my life (does anyone pls help lmao), so i feel like maybe that’s not the right term for me idk.

#writer is giving manic pixie dream girl	#wtf is going on	#lol	#jo march i still love you	#i have a problem		#who am i	#writing


okay thinking thoughts abt this. i think i can be a person who writes without….being a ~writer~… idk, i just have a lot of feelings and i feel like it can come out in a lot of ways, but mostly comes out through writing?? been journaling a lot more and feel like it helps me cope with things. i feel like i only write when it i feel like i need to or if i have something to say. i can’t like force the fucking words out of me or something as much as i wish i could, especially when i have to pull something out of my ass for class😵‍💫😵‍💫

#yup she has feelings 	#help me	#i am word vomiting	#wtf is writing


okay like…maybe i am a writer? anyone else make shit up in their head😭(no seriously). might be actually getting somewhere with this, idk if it has any traction but at least i’m enjoying it and i’m trying to tell myself that that’s all that matters. i don’t need to like have an actual job where this is my passion (i mean i could you don’t know what i’m capable of🤨) but like what i mean to say is it can just be and i can just be and i can just like writing and have that be the end of it. i can call myself a writer and have it mean nothing or it could mean everything but at the end of the day what it means only matters to me.

#lol	#writing 	#writing is weird		#i don’t know what i’m doing
